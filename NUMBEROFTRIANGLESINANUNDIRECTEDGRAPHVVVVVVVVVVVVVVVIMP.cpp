// A C++ program for finding 
// number of triangles in an

/* VVVVVVVVVVVVVIMP result
If we compute An for an adjacency matrix representation of graph, then a value An[i][j] represents
 number of distinct walks between vertex i to j in graph of length n. In A3, we get all distinct paths of length 
 3 between every pair of vertices.

A triangle is a cyclic path of length three, i.e. begins and ends at same vertex. So A3[i][i] represents
 a triangle beginning and ending with vertex i. Since a triangle has three vertices and it is counted for 
 every vertex, we need to divide result by 3. Furthermore, since the graph is undirected, every triangle
  twice as i-p-q-j and i-q-p-j, so we divide by 2 also. Therefore, number of triangles is trace(A3) / 6.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of above algorithm is O(V3) where V is number of vertices in the graph, we can improve
	 the performance to O(V2.8074) using Strassenâ€™s matrix multiplication algorithm.
