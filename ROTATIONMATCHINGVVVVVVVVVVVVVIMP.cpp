/*
After the mysterious disappearance of Ashish, his two favourite disciples Ishika and Hriday, were each left with one half of a
 secret message. These messages can each be represented by a permutation of size n. Let's call them a and b.

Note that a permutation of n elements is a sequence of numbers a1,a2,â€¦,an, in which every number from 1 to n appears exactly once.

The message can be decoded by an arrangement of sequence a and b, such that the number of matching pairs of elements between them
 is maximum. A pair of elements ai and bj is said to match if:

i=j, that is, they are at the same index.
ai=bj
His two disciples are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:

choose a number k and cyclically shift one of the permutations to the left or right k times.
