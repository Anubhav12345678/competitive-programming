/* Sample run of the Algo for V1 with capacity 3 and V2 with capacity 7 
1. Fill V1:							 V1 = 3, V2 = 0 
2. Transfer from V1 to V2, and fill V1: V1 = 3, V2 = 3 
2. Transfer from V1 to V2, and fill V1: V1 = 3, V2 = 6 
3. Transfer from V1 to V2, and empty V2: V1 = 2, V2 = 0 
4. Transfer from V1 to V2, and fill V1: V1 = 3, V2 = 2 
5. Transfer from V1 to V2, and fill V1: V1 = 3, V2 = 5 
6. Transfer from V1 to V2, and empty V2: V1 = 1, V2 = 0 
7. Stop as V1 now contains 1 litre. 

Note that V2 was made empty in steps 3 and 6 because it became full */
