/*
There are n oranges in the kitchen and you decided to eat some of these oranges every day as follows:

Eat one orange.
If the number of remaining oranges (n) is divisible by 2 then you can eat  n/2 oranges.
If the number of remaining oranges (n) is divisible by 3 then you can eat  2*(n/3) oranges.
You can only choose one of the actions per day.

Return the minimum number of days to eat n oranges.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: You have 10 oranges.
Day 1: Eat 1 orange,  10 - 1 = 9.  
Day 2: Eat 6 oranges, 9 - 2*(9/3) = 9 - 6 = 3. (Since 9 is divisible by 3)
Day 3: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. 
Day 4: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.
You need at least 4 days to eat the 10 oranges.
