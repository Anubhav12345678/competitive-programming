/*
Chef recently read about the mex function and came up with a function similar to that. For a (possibly empty) sequence
 of positive integers S, Chef defines f(S) as the smallest positive integer that does not appear in S.
  For example, f([])=1, f([3,4,3,5])=1, f([2,5,1,1,2,3])=4.

Chef's friend heard about Chef's idea and found it really cool. Therefore, he sent a sequence a1,a2,â€¦,aN to
 Chef and asked him to find the sum of f(S) over all 2N possible subsequences S of this sequence.
  Since Chef is busy, he entrusted you with solving the problem.

Since the resulting sum can be very big, compute it modulo  998,244,353
